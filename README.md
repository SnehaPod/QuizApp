# This app is a quiz application made in Vuejs which randomizes questions on every refresh

The app uses a JSON API to populate multiple choice questions for the quiz and the user can choose one of the multiple options as their answer.

On clicking the submit button, the user will receive an instant feedback on the result of the quiz based on their answers. The result will also 
be visualized using a bar chart.
